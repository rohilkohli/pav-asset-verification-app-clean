#### Mitigation for xlsx vulnerability

The xlsx vulnerability poses a lower risk for this application because:

1. **Controlled Environment**: This is an internal asset verification tool, not a public-facing application
2. **Trusted Input**: Files are uploaded by trusted internal users, not arbitrary external sources
3. **Local Storage**: Data is processed and stored locally in the browser's localStorage
4. **No Remote Execution**: The application doesn't execute server-side code or expose APIs

#### Recommendations

If the xlsx vulnerability becomes a concern in the future, consider these options:

1. **Upgrade to commercial version**: SheetJS offers commercial licenses with security fixes
2. **Alternative libraries**: Consider switching to alternatives like:
   - `exceljs` - Full Excel file manipulation
   - `xlsx-populate` - Excel file creation and manipulation
   - `papaparse` - CSV parsing (if Excel format is not strictly required)
3. **Backend processing**: Move file parsing to a backend service with additional security controls

## Security Best Practices

When using this application:

1. Only upload Excel/CSV files from trusted sources
2. Avoid uploading files from unknown or untrusted origins
3. Review file contents before processing
4. Keep the application updated with the latest dependency versions
5. Run `npm audit` regularly to check for new vulnerabilities
